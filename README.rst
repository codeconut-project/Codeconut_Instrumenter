.. begin abstract

COdeCOnut is a invasive code coverage utility used for C or C++ code.
The provided metrics adhere to the standards and requirements of the
automotive and aviation industry (i.e. ISO 26262).

The goal is to create a free to use code coverage tool that supports metrics
which are more helpful and easier to unserstand than the ones from
existing tools (i.e. gcov).
This means, that COdeCOnut is a invasive code coverage tool that instruments your
source code prior to the compilation process.
Using this method, COdeCOnut is able to generate the execution tables
necessary for MC/DC coverage analysis. 

COdeCOnut is the project of Glenn Töws' bachelor thesis for his degree in electrical engineering
and currently is in it's planning phase.
