.. begin abstract

COdeCOvA is a invasive code coverage utility used for C or C++ code.
The provided metrics adhere to the standards and requirements of the
automotive and aviation industry (i.e. ISO 26262).

The goal is to create a free to use code coverage tool that supports metrics
which are more helpful and easier to unserstand than the ones from
existing tools (i.e. gcov).
This means, that COdeCOvA is a invasive code coverage tool that instruments your
source code prior to the compilation process.
Using this method, COdeCOvA is able to generate the execution tables
necessary for MC/DC coverage analysis. 

COdeCOvA is the project of Glenn Töws' bachelor thesis for his degree in electrical engineering
and currently is in it's planning phase.

See LICENSE for the license of the COdeCOvA project.
