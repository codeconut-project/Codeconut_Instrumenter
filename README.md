Codeconut Instrumenter is a invasive code coverage utility used for C or C++ code.
The provided metrics adhere to the standards and requirements of the
automotive and aviation industry (i.e. ISO 26262).

The goal is to create a free to use code coverage tool that supports
metrics which are more helpful and easier to understand than the ones
from existing tools (i.e. gcov). Codeconut is a
invasive code coverage tool that instruments your source code prior to
the compilation process. Using this method, Codeconut is able to
generate the execution tables necessary for MC/DC coverage analysis.

Codeconut is the project of Glenn Töws' bachelor thesis for his degree
in electrical engineering and currently is in it's planning phase.
